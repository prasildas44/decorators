# decorators

Decorators are used to reduce rewriting of same code in diffrent part of programme/function (DRY rule). 
for that we need to create a new function and explain everything inside it, use @name_of_function before starting the function(whereever the repetative code is available)
in this example i used function - @time_it to count the process time for each function and placed decorator function to the first line of all function
